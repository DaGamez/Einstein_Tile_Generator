# Einstein Tile Generator
![Einstein Pattern](pattern_image.png)

## How to run it
The files needed to run the pattern generator are `geometry.py` which contains different functions for matrix transformations, `graphics_tk.py` which draws the pattern, `pattern_generator.py` which contains the algorithm for generating the pattern, and `main.py` which runs the program. The only libraries which you need to have installed are "math" which comes preinstalled with python and "tkinter" which can be installed by running `pip install tk`. Then to launch the program run `main.py` using `python3 main.py`. This will open a window with the first generation of the pattern. To move to the next generation just close the window and a new window will pop up with the next generation of the pattern.
